# ordered_file_maintainence

Input takes in an integer n, and an array with n elements, and it creates an ordered file with gaps of size 1 between each two elements.
Insert queries are performed indefinetelly, although this will change in later versions. Each insert takes two integers as input: the 0-indexed position in the ordered file array and the value to be inserted
